# AI-Based Risk Analysis & Decision System

An explainable AI credit risk decision framework that integrates Machine Learning models and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transparent loan approval recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world financial lending decision engine.  
The system evaluates applicant financial data, predicts default probability, and generates human-readable explanations for approval or rejection decisions.

The goal is to demonstrate how modern FinTech platforms combine predictive modeling and explainable AI to support fair and auditable decision making.
